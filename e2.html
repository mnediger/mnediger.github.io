                    <p class="fw-light">Venngage is a web-based graphic design platform, launched in 2015. By 2021, product development within the design editor, the core of Venngage’s product, was slowing due to technical debt.</p>
                    <p class="fw-light">To allow us to ship more quickly and reposition Venngage as an accessible design platform, technical leaders decided it was time to rebuild the editor from the ground up.</p>
                    <p class="fw-light">We’ve been working since the spring of 2022 to <span class="fw-bold">design, build, and launch a new editor.</span></p>

                <hr>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">The large scope of this project posed a significant challenge&mdash;<i>how would we ship valuable slices that would be good enough to entice users to adopt the new editor, while the alternative, a fully-featured editor, was still available?</i></p>

                    <p class="fw-light">We had to be strategic about how we defined the scope for alpha, beta, and full public launches. Make them large enough that they provided value and enabled us to get continuous feedback, but small enough that we could ship relatively quickly.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-bold">Alpha</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">We decided that the objective for alpha would be to evaluate the usability and value of a <a href="accessible-designer.html">flow to help users create accessible designs</a>&mdash;a new use case we were tackling alongside rebuilding the editor&mdash;in moderated user tests. This way, the editor didn't need to be integrated with our existing product or database, dramatically reducing the amount of work we needed to do before we could get it into users' hands.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">We could also offer barebones functionality&mdash;single-page designs, a text widget, a few basic shapes, some icons, basic image uploads, and PDF downloads&mdash;without worrying too much about the usability of the basic editing experience. This would be enough for users to create complete simple designs, but wouldn't take more than a few months to build.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-bold">Beta</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">For beta, the editor would need to be a bit more full-featured, since we wanted to get real usage data with paid users. Here, I leveraged analytics data from our existing editor to define critical flows for engaged customers to define a "good-enough" beta scope. </p>
