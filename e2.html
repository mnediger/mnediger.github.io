                    <hr>

                    <p class="fw-light">Venngage is a web-based graphic design platform, launched in 2015. By 2021, product development within the design editor, the core of Venngage’s product, was slowing due to technical debt.</p>
                    <p class="fw-light">To allow us to ship more quickly and reposition Venngage as an accessible design platform, technical leaders decided it was time to rebuild the editor from the ground up.</p>
                    <p class="fw-light">We’ve been working since the spring of 2022 to <span class="fw-bold">design, build, and launch a new editor.</span></p>

                <p class="fw-light mb-0">To kick off the project I performed a usability evaluation, interviewed internal and external users, carried out a customer support analysis, and a quick competitive analysis. This data, alongside quantitative analyses of analytics data from our existing editor, would inform the planning and prioritization of our incremental releases over the next year.</p>
                
                <p class="fw-light">While getting started on solving some of the more fundamental issues defined in this early research, I also set out to define some goals and slices that would guide our work within this large project.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold">Defining a roadmap for alpha, beta, and public launches</p>
                <hr>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">The large scope of this project posed a significant challenge&mdash;<i>how would we ship valuable slices that would be good enough to entice users to adopt the new editor, while the alternative, a fully-featured editor, was still available?</i></p>

                    <p class="fw-light">We had to be strategic about how we defined the scope for alpha, beta, and full public launches. Make them large enough that they provided value and enabled us to get continuous feedback, but small enough that we could ship relatively quickly.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">Alpha</h3>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">We decided that the objective for alpha would be to evaluate the usability and value of a <a href="accessible-designer.html">flow to help users create accessible designs</a>&mdash;a new use case we were tackling alongside rebuilding the editor&mdash;in moderated user tests. This way, the editor didn't need to be integrated with our existing product or database, dramatically reducing the amount of work we needed to do before we could get it into users' hands.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">We could also offer barebones functionality&mdash;single-page designs, a text widget, a few basic shapes, some icons, basic image uploads, and PDF downloads&mdash;without worrying too much about the usability of the basic editing experience. This would be enough for users to create complete simple designs, but wouldn't take more than a few months to build.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-bold">Plus, when we launched our beta, we could position the new editor as a way to make accessible designs, which wasn't possible in the existing editor.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">Beta</h3>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">For beta, the editor would need to be a bit more full-featured, since we wanted to get real usage data with existing paid customers. Here, I leveraged analytics data from our existing editor to define critical flows for engaged customers to define a "good-enough" beta scope. </p>

                    <p class="fw-light">Once we were confident that the basic editing experience was functional and stable (through feedback and usage data from paid customers), our next milestone would be a release to new users. This would allow us to get feedback on the learnability of the new editing experience, unbiased by experiences with the old editor.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">At our initial release to new users, upgrade rates from the new editor were similar to those from the old editor.</p>

                <p class="fw-light">While we made numerous changes to UX details, redesigned a number of widgets, and redesigned the UI alongside building Venngage's first design system, here are some of the more significant usability issues we solved in the redesign.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Problem</h4>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">When the text widget was last updated in the old editor, ease of editing the text content was prioritized over all else in the editing experience for the text widget. Clicking once on a text widget would bypass the widget selected state and move directly into a text editing state.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">Session recordings revealed a few very common flows that this existing UX wasn't accommodating well.</p>
                    
                <ol class="fw-light">
                    <li><span class="fw-bold">Delete the widget via keyboard:</span> users would click once on a text widget to select it, then use the Delete key with the intent to delete the widget. But because of the drilldown behaviour we had in place, this would only delete the content of the text widget - leaving placeholder content ("Click to edit text") showing when the user deselected the widget.</li>
                    <li><span class="fw-bold">Move the widget:</span> users would click once on a text widget to select it, then try to drag to move it. Because the first click put them in an edit state, dragging highlighted the text content rather than moving the widget.</li>
                </ol>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">Despite running into these flows repeatedly, users would continue to make the errors - suggesting to us that the design wasn't aligning with user mental models.</p>
                
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Solution</h4>
                    
                    <p class="fw-light">I assessed all of the potential types of edits that a user might intend to make when they interact with a text widget:</p>
                
                    <ul class="fw-light">
                            <li>Edit the content (prioritized in the old editing experience)</li>
                            <li>Replace the content (prioritized in the old editing experience)</li>
                            <li>Edit the style of some of the text in the widget (prioritized in the old editing experience)</li>
                            <li>Edit the style of all of the text in the widget</li>
                            <li>Edit the style of the text in multiple widgets</li>
                            <li>Move the widget</li>
                            <li>Delete the widget</li>
                            <li>Duplicate the widget</li>
                            <li>Change the layer position of the widget</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">With all of the flows in mind, it became clearer that the current drilldown behaviour prioritized too few flows at the expense of too many.</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">In the new editor, we added an additional state to the text widget interactions:</p>
                
                <ul class="fw-light">
                    <li>1st click: selects the text widget</li>
                    <li>2nd click: enters text edit mode</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4">6. Adding an on-canvas affordance for unlocking widgets</h3>
                    
                <h4 class="mb-3">Problem</h4>
                    <p class="fw-light">Session recordings revealed that many users struggled to understand that widgets were locked, and needed to be unlocked to be moved or resized. Locking is an important part of template design - locking widgets used as background elements allows for easier editing of foreground elements (which is what most users spend most of their time editing).</p>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">The old locked widget bounding box UI relied on color and a small lock symbol that was easily missed.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mb-3">Solution</h4>
                    <p class="fw-light">We tweaked this UI to make the lock icon more noticeable (larger, with a white background) and also made it interactive, so users to click  it to unlock the widget, instead of having to go to the in-context toolbar or right click menu.</p>
