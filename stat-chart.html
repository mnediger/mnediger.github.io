                <h2 class="mt-5 mb-1">Understanding pain points</h2>
                <hr>

                    <p class="fw-light">This type of simple visualization is a feature of many user designs and templates. For users to update a design with their data, they had to edit and adjust each component separately, including:</p>
                    <ul class="fw-light">
                        <li class="mb-3">Edit the percentage text on the canvas with their value</li>
                        <li class="mb-3">Update the chart with the same value</li>
                        <li class="mb-3">Adjust the size and position of the chart, the text, and the icon depending on the number of digits in their value</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <p class="fw-light">If the user wanted to try out a different chart type or add or remove an icon, they’d have to reconfigure the composition completely: moving, resizing, and adjusting each component to make the layout presentable.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold mb-5">As a result, most users stuck very closely to the template design, even if that wasn’t ideal for their content, or how they wanted to display their data.</p>

                    <div class="row gx-5 mt-5 mb-5">
                        <div class="col-12 text-center">

                    <p class="fw-light">The widget must be flexible enough in style and structure to replicate the way this type of data is represented in existing templates, all while responding to the user’s content. </p>
                    <p class="fw-light">I collected and analyzed examples of this use case from both templates and user designs, and defined the following similarities and variations:</p>

                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Chart type:</span> donut, half-donut, progress bar, pictogram</li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Layout:</span> text, icon, visual inside or below the chart</li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Chart style:</span> corner rounding, chart thickness, color</li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Icon:</span> color, may be present or absent</li>
                    </ul>

                <hr>
                
                <h3>Resizing &amp; layout variety: balancing usability, flexibility, and effort</h3>
                <p class="fw-light">After cataloguing a variety of examples from user designs and templates, I categorized them with the goal of understanding what unique  considerations each combination of chart type and layout might require for the resizing behaviour.</p>
                
                <p> IMAGE - categorized</p>
                
                <p class="fw-light">The resizing behaviour for layouts that included only one element with a flexible aspect ratio seemed simple enough to define: the elements with fixed aspect ratios could remain the same size while the element with a flexible aspect ratio could adjust to fill the available space while the widget was resized. </p>
                
                <p class="fw-light">The height of the widget could respond to the changes, as necessary, consistent with the resizing behaviour for our existing text widget.</p>
                
                <p class="fw-light">Since the alignment of elements within the widget tended to be consistent for each layout type (arrangement of elements), that didn't need to be under user control--it could simply be defined as part of the layout.</p>
                
                <p> IMAGE - resizing behaviour examples</p>
                
                <p class="fw-light">But if we wanted to offer layouts that combined a flexible-aspect ratio chart and the flexible-aspect ratio description text in the same row, we would need to define how the the width of each component was impacted as the widget was resize (or define a method to resize elements within the widget, rather than resizing the widget itself). </p>
                
                <p> IMAGE - some options for resizing layouts with elements with flexible aspect ratios in the same row</p>
                
                <p class="fw-light">I spent some time defining and prototyping possible approaches and testing them internally. </p>
                
                <h3>Information architecture explorations: maintaining consistency with other widgets</h3>
                <p class="fw-light">Toolbar or right menu?</p>
